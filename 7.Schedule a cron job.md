# Scheduling using Cronjob

## How Cronjob works
1. A cron job is a scheduled task that runs automatically at specified intervals.
2. Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems (like Linux). You can use it to run scripts or commands at predefined times.
3. First we have to install Cron by command ```apt install cron ```
4. Then we have to edit crontab file by open the crontab editor ```crontab -e```

   | | | | +---- Day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday is both 0 and 7)

   | | | +------ Month (1 - 12)

   | | +-------- Day of the month (1 - 31)

   1. ```0 0 * * * /path/to/script.sh``` - Run a script every day at midnight.
   2. ```30 5 * * 1 /path/to/script.sh``` - Run a script every Monday at 5:30 AM.
   3. ```*/15 * * * * /path/to/script.sh``` - Run a script every 15 minutes.
   4. ```0 0 1 * * /path/to/script.sh``` - Run a script on the 1st of every month at midnight.
7. Save and check list of cronjobs by ```crontab -l```
8. Making the Script Executable by ```chmod +x /path/to/script.sh```
