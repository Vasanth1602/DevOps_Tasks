**Task Summary:**
    Use docker to setup a linux server.
    Using docker desktop to pull a latest ubuntu image and create a container with that image by allocating the port 2222:22 to access the server.
    Need to install ssh server and client and make access to it.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**


    ->docker pull ubuntu

    ->Install and Start SSH Server in the Container;
    -docker run -d --name ssh_server -p 2222:22 ubuntu bash (Run a new container in a detached mode with allocated ssh port(2222))
    -docker exec -it ssh_server (Access the running container)
    -apt update && apt install -y openssh-server
    -passwd (if you want to setup a password for root)

    ->Install and Start SSH Client in the Container;
    -docker run -d --name ssh_client -p ubuntu bash
    -docker exec -it ssh_client
    -apt update && apt install -y openssh_client

        >Set up authorized keys for SSH access;
            -ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 (Generate public key and saves in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

    ->copy the public key to the root .ssh as authorized_keys in server;
    -cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub (Run the command in client it shows generated public key copy the key and paste it in server .ssh/authorized keys)
    -nano .ssh/authorized_keys (Run it in client and paste the public key)

    ->Set proper permissions for the .ssh directory and authorized_keys file in server;
    -chmod 700 /root/.ssh
    -chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

    ->Configure the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config;
    -nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config (For read and edit)
    -PubkeyAuthentication yes
     PasswordAuthentication no
     PermitRootLogin no
     AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys (save the file)
    
    -service ssh start
    
    ->Access server through client;
    -ssh root@<server's ip address>

**Adding user in server**
    -adduser vasanth (it asks to set password and want to enter some basic details)
     "we have to copy the authorized_keys from /root/.ssh/authorized_keys to /home/vasanth/.ssh.authorized_keys"
    -cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/vasanth/.ssh/authorized_keys 
     *Ensure the .ssh directory exists ,if there is no directory such as .ssh in vasanth we have to create it manually by 'mkdir .ssh'

    ->Set correct permissions;
    -chmod 700 /home/vasanth/.ssh
     chmod 600 /home/vasanth/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ->Change ownership;
    -chown -R vasanth:vasanth /home/vasanth/.ssh

    -service ssh restart

    ->Access server through client;
    -ssh vasanth@<server's ip address>

**Issues Faced & Solutions**
    1.Change ownership issue make public key access denied:
        We have to check the ownership of the .ssh directory and authorized_keys file in it by "ls -l"
        we should set the ownership for both directory and file
