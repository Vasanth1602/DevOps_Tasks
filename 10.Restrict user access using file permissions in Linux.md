# Restrict user access

## Understand File Permissions:
Linux file permissions are controlled by three main types of users and three types of permissions:
* Users:
    1. Owner (u): The user who owns the file.
    2. Group (g): The group associated with the file.
    3. Others (o): All other users.
* Permissions:
    1. r: Read (view the contents of the file).
    2. w: Write (modify the file).
    3. x: Execute (run the file as a program).

## Set Permissions Using chmod:
**Numeric Example:**
Permissions are represented as three digits, where each digit corresponds to owner, group, and others.
- 7: Read, write, and execute (rwx)
- 6: Read and write (rw-)
- 5: Read and execute (r-x)
- 4: Read only (r--)
- 3: Write and execute (wx-)
- 2: Write only (w--)
- 1: Execute only (x--)
- 0: No permissions (---)

*Example* - ```chmod 750 myfile.txt``` (u: rwx, g: r-x, o: ---)

**Symbolic Example:**
- ```chmod u+x myfile.txt``` (Adds execute permission to the owner)
- ```chmod g-w myfile.txt``` (Removes write permission from the group)
- ```chmod o=r myfile.txt``` (Sets read-only permission for others)

## Retrict User Access:
- ```chown root:root /app/myfile.txt && chmod 600 /app/myfile.txt``` (This sets the file permissions to be read and writable only by the root user and no access for others.)
- Like this we can able to set fike permission to the certain files based on our need.
