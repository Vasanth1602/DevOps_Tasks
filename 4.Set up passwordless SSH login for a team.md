**one client -> Multiple user in server**

    =>Generate private/public key by using command;
        -ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "" (In client container)
        #It saves the key at .ssh/id_rsa
    =>Copy the key to every user in a server at .ssh/authorized_keys;
        #you can manually copy the key from client and paste it to authorized_keys , for this process you have to set permission for the .ssh directory and authorized_keys file.
        -chmod 700 .ssh/
        -chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys 
    =>Restart service;
        -service ssh restart
    =>Accessing Multiple server from client;
        -ssh <user_in_server>@<server's_ip>

**one server -> Multiple client(user in client container)**

    =>Generate private/public key in every client (user in client container/team members);
        -ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""
        #You have to run the command in every user/member by changing the user,
            -su <username> (command for change user)
    =>copy the key;
        #Copy the key from every user in client container and paste all key in server at .ssh as authorized_keys.
        #set the permissions.
    =>Restart service;
        -service ssh restart
    =>Accessing server from multiple client;
        -ssh <user_in_server>@<server's_ip>
        #For another user/member-change the client user by command,
            -su <username_in_client> ,then
            -ssh <user_in_server>@<server's_ip>
        #For another user/member, repeat the above process.
