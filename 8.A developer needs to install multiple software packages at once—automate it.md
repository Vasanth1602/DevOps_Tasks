# Create Software Installation Script (install_software.sh):
## ```install_software.sh```
```bash
#!/bin/bash

#update the system
echo "updating the system..."
apt update -y

#upgrade the existing packages
echo "upgrading system"
apt upgrade -y

#List of Packages to install
Packages=(
  "git"
  "curl"
  "vim"
  "htop"
  "nginx"
  "docker.io"
  "nodejs"
  "python3-pip"
  "build-essential"
  "net-tools"
  "cron"
)

#Installing the Packages if not installed
for Package in "${Packages[@]}"; do
    echo "Checking if $Package is installed..."

    #check if Package is installed
    if dpkg -l | grep -q "^ii $Package"; then
        echo "$Package is alreaady installed and up-to-date."
    else
         echo "$Package is not installed or not up-to-date. Installing..."
        apt install -y $Package
    fi
done

echo "Software installation completed"
```

## Note
1. Making the Script Executable by  ```chmod +x /path/to/install_software.sh```
2. There are also thousands of packages in the linux system, these are some basic packages.
3. ${PACKAGES[@]} - expands to each individual Package name within the PACKAGES array as a separate argument.
4. dpkg -l: This command lists all installed Packages on your system.
5. grep -q "^ii $Package": This searches for the Package name ($Package) in the list of installed packages.
   1. ^ii indicates that the package is installed and in a fully configured state.
   2. If the package is found, it means the package is already installed and up-to-date. The script will then skip installation.

## Consequence faced
=>When i create a script it does not skip if a package is already installed so it gets looped to a first packsge itself so then i modified it to skip if the package is installed.
