# Writing Bash Script for service check

## Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

#Specify the name of the service
 Service="sshd"

#check if the server is running
if pgrep -x "$Service" > /dev/null 2>&1 then;
     echo "$Service is running."
else
    echo "$Service is not running.Restarting..."

    #Service restrating
    /usr/sbin/sshd -D &

    #check if the server is restarted
    if pgrep -x "$Service" > /dev/null 2>&1 then;
        echo "$Service restarted successfully"
    else
        echo "Failed to restart $Service"
    fi
fi
 ```

## Note
1. If we use any other service like apache,nginx ,etc,.. we have to specify it in Service variable.
2. pgrep - To check the service running in exact name
3. Command :  > /dev/null -  This redirects standard output (stdout) of a command to /dev/null, which is a special file that discards any data written to it.
4. 2>&1 - This redirects standard error (stderr) to the same location as standard output (stdout).
        2 refers to the file descriptor for stderr.
        >&1 means redirect stderr (2) to the same place as stdout (1).
5. Using > /dev/null 2>&1 together ensures that both standard output and error messages are sent to /dev/null.
